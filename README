rscurl.sh is an atempt to create a command line tool that interfaces with Rackspace Cloud Server's API.  The goal in creating it was to use widely available tools so it is written as a shell script and uses apt, curl, grep, sed, and tr.  

It supports the following commands:

		list-servers	- Lists all the servers you have on your account.
		list-flavors	- Lists all the types of server that are available to you.
		list-images		- Lists all the server images that are available to you.
		create-server	- Creates a new server
		delete-server	- Deletes a server
		rebuild			- Rebuilds a server with the new image, all data will be lost.
		resize			- Resizes a server
		confirm-resize	- Confirms a recently resized server, after 24 hours it is done automatically.
		revert-resize	- Reverts a recently resized server to the previous size.
		reboot			- Reboots a server
		force-reboot	- Forces a server to reboot, equivalent to pulling the power.
		create-image	- Creates a new image based on an existing server.
		delete-image	- Deletes a server image that you own.

Here is an example of the output for the servers, flavors, and images.
